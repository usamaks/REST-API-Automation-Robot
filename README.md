# REST-API-Automation-using-Robot-Framework

This repository contains an example project for testing REST APIs using Robot Framework. The project demonstrates how to perform 

GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests using the RequestsLibrary and how to validate the response using JSON validation


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Robot Framework
- RequestsLibrary
- JSONSchema

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/usamaks/REST-API-Automation-using-Robot-Framework.git

2. Install the dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   
 The Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has a built-in support for creating and running tests for RESTful APIs using the robotframework-requests library, which is a Robot Framework library for making HTTP requests.

To use the robotframework-requests library, you first need to install it by running pip install robotframework-requests. Once it is installed, you can import the library in your test case file and use its keywords to make HTTP requests, such as Get Request, Post Request, Put Request and Delete Request.
